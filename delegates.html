I’m currently a sophomore pursuing a degree in computer science. I spend my summers in the mountains working for the Town of Dillon. When I’m not cubing or serving as the leader of the Ethics Committee, you can find me biking, cross-country skiing with my two dogs, or coding a new project. I am very passionate about organizing in unique regions and bringing cubing to every corner of the state. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me for anything! I’m always happy to help however I can. </div>

I enjoy big cubes and blindfolded events, and I especially enjoy 6x6 and 7x7 blindfolded. I am usually busy with statistics and coding projects, reading historical and realistic fiction, enjoying the outdoors, and cooking. One of my favorite parts of delegating is helping first time organizers and staff get involved, and I believe everyone can make a difference! Feel free to reach out to me for anything you might need; I am passionate about making sure each and every cuber can make the most of this community!</div>

I am mainly interested in the blindfolded events since I am too old to be fast at any other event. When I'm not cubing, I like to spend my free time reading books, playing board games and cooking new recipes. Some of my favorite board games are Cosmic Encounter and Inis. I've really enjoyed reading War and Peace by Tolstoy, The Dispossed by Le Guin, and Satantango by Krasnahorkai. I am happy trying to cook any type of food I can, from homemade pasta to curries to ramen and more.</div>

I’m currently working on my Bachelor's degree in Applied Math and Statistics at Colorado School of Mines. I started cubing in January 2020, competed online that same year, organized two online competitions of my own in 2021, and began competing officially that November. Since then, I’ve competed in almost forty competitions, organized four of my own, and added two more online competitions to my resume. In my free time, l like to hike, make music, play tennis, listen to Ed Sheeran, exercise my epic SolidWorks skills, as well as solve Rubik’s Cubes every once in a while. I’m excited to have this opportunity to better serve my area as a delegate, as well as to  work with the WCA and all of you in coming years to support and grow our incredible community.
